# Workout-Tracker

An exercise tracking application using Python and Google sheets. The app uses a smart natural language tracking API which provides the amount of calories burned from the exercise done. This information is then printed to Google sheets. 

Python dateTime and strftime methods are used in this project as well as using an API and creating authorisation headers. 

The main focus of this project was learning about environment variables.
